for min max, the time complexity is O(N), because it checks each value once in the for loop.
I couldn't complete hackerrank,, but the way it was designed should have also had O(n) time, because it would check each character once.

Minmax would have constant space complextity because the number of variables wouldn't scale with size.
Hackerrank would only need the space of the strings and the i in the loop, giving it space complexity O(n)
