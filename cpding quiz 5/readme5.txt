plus minus runs in O(N) times because it checks each number once, then totals them, which takes the longest. 
It also opperates in connstant memory, because the space of the integers and floats it uses doesn't scale with input time.
My fibbonacci may not pass any test cases, but thats because I couldn't figure out ho to turn the long I needed into an integer.
if you test any case, you see it does the math correctly. I returned ) on purpose because it wouldn't compile otherwise, but the "answer" i found is what it prints.
