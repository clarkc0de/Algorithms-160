In the coin change problem, the run time is exponential, due to the fact that for every call that isn't a base case, two more calls are made. While the variables themselves are of constant space, the recursion depth gives it linnear space complexity.

I was once again short on time for my second solution, but a recursive solution should look very similar to what I provided, minus the memoization.
